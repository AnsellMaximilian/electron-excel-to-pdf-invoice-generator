# Invoice Generator Using Electron

## Background

At a job I have, I hold a responsibility to convert recorded customer transactions in an excel file into invoice PDFs that can be sent to the respective customers. The task had always been fundementally simple and straightforward, and at first I quickly came up with an equally simple solution: I created an invoice template from a PivotTable and formatted it to display all the necessary information, and then I would filter through the transaction data by each unique customer and save the resulting PivotTable as PDF one by one, and then save those PDF invoices somewhere in the computer until ready to be sent. However, that method was very unecessarily time-consuming. I would usually take around 10 seconds to create an invoice for one single customer, and I would make near 100 invoices every week.

As I was given freedom on how the invoices could look like, I decided to look for alternative ways to generate the invoices automatically from the data in the Excel file. I figured what I wanted to do, roughly:

- Choose and Excel file
- Generate PDF invoices for every unique customer in the file

This would yield the same result I had gotten from manually creating the PDFs. Since I would be the only one using the application, I opted to make a desktop application.

### Disclaimer

I realize the root of the problem is probably the underlying system itself of using an Excel file to record transactions and then turning the data inside into invoices, but I made this application just to fix a very specific problem, which is the time being wasted filtering and saving PivotTables as PDFs.
